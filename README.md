# CarryLookAhead_adder
The Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) is an optimized digital circuit used to perform high-speed binary addition. Unlike traditional ripple-carry adders, which propagate the carry bit through each stage sequentially, the CLA generates carry signals in parallel, significantly reducing the addition time.

In the simulation of the Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) using Xilinx Vivado, carry overflow occurs when the sum of two binary numbers exceeds the representable limit for the adder's bit-width. This is typically indicated by a carry-out from the most significant bit (MSB), which cannot be accommodated within the adder's fixed bit-width. Overflow in binary addition often represents an arithmetic error in signed numbers, where the result goes beyond the allowable range. Correct handling of overflow is crucial for maintaining accuracy in high-precision arithmetic operations.
