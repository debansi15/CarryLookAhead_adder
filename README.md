# CarryLookAhead_adder
The Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA) is an optimized digital circuit used to perform high-speed binary addition. Unlike traditional ripple-carry adders, which propagate the carry bit through each stage sequentially, the CLA generates carry signals in parallel, significantly reducing the addition time.
